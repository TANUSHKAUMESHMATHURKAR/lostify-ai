# Lostify AI 🔍

Lostify AI is an AI-powered Lost & Found platform designed to help campuses and local communities recover lost items quickly and efficiently using Google technologies.


## 🚀 Problem Statement
Lost items on campuses often rely on notice boards, word of mouth, or social media posts, which are slow, unorganized, and unreliable. There is no centralized, intelligent system to match lost and found items effectively.


## 💡 Our Solution
Lostify AI provides a centralized Lost & Found platform with live location support and AI-based matching. Users can report lost or found items, view them on a live feed, and use Google Maps to track locations. An AI-ready matching system helps identify possible matches between lost and found reports.


## ✨ Key Features
- 📝 Lost & Found item reporting
- 📍 Live user location using Google Maps
- 🗺️ Map-based visualization of items
- 🤖 AI-based item matching (Gemini-ready mock)
- ⭐ User reviews & verified badges
- 📊 Real-time feed with match percentage


## 🛠️ Google Technologies Used (Mandatory)
- **Google Maps API** – map embedding & location visualization  
- **Browser Geolocation API** – live user location tracking  
- **Google Gemini** – AI matching logic (mock implementation, integration-ready)  
- **Google Cloud Ready Architecture** – scalable deployment design  


## 🧠 AI & Future Scope
Currently, Lostify AI uses a mock AI matching logic for the MVP. In the next phase, Google Gemini will be integrated to perform semantic similarity analysis between lost and found item descriptions for more accurate matching.
